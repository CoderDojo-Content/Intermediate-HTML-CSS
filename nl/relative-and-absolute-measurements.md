1. Up until now you've been using **pixels** to set the size of things, e.g. `10px`. This is called an **absolute** measurement. It means you set an exact size and it doesn't change. Another way to set the size of things is using **relative** measurements. That means how big elements are in relation to each other. So when one thing changes size, everything else will automatically change as well to keep the same **proportions**. 

2. Go to index.html and find the **img** element with the picture of Tito. Delete the width attribute if `width="100px"` if it's there, and give the element an **id** of _imgTito_.
  ```html
    <img id="imgTito" src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog" />
  ``` 

3. In your CSS file find the `#imgTito` code block and add the `width` property below:
  ```css
    #imgTito {
      border-radius: 100%;
      width: 50%;
    }
  ```
 50% (50 percent) is **half**. Try a few different percentages and see if you can work out what it's doing.

4. When you're using **relative** measurements it's important to know what the **parent** of your element is. The **parent** is the thing that your element is inside, and that's what the measurement will be in relation to. For example, **parent** of the image above is the **article** element because the **img** element is in between the `<article></article>` tags.
5. Now in your html file, put the image inside a **section** element with **id** _titoSection_. Include some text in the section too. 
   ```html
      <section id="titoSection">
      <img id="imgTito" src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog" />  		
      <p>
        This is Tito. He will be your tourguide! As you can see, Tito loves CoderDojo.
      </p>
    </section>
   ```

6. Add the following code to your stylesheet, so you can see what's going on more clearly
 ```css
  #titoSection {
    width: 200px;
    background-color: white;
  }
 ```
 * If you don't give **section** elements a width, they fill up all the space available, which is usually a good thing!

7. You should notice that the picture is much smaller now. That is because it is taking up 50% of the width of the **section** element instead of the **article** element \(which is roughly the width of the page\).

8. Another **relative** unit of measurement is `em`, which is related to the size of your text. **Cut** the heading `<h1>Welcome to Ireland!</h1>` and **paste** it on a new line _above_ the opening `<article>` tag, so that it's outside of the `article` element. Add a class **attribute** to the heading as well.
  ```html
    <main>	
      <h1 class="funsize">Welcome to Ireland!</h1>
      <article id="frontPageArticle">
  ```
 Then, in your CSS file, add the following code. There is a border so you can see the spacing more easily.
 ```css
    .funsize {
      border: 2px solid #FFFFFF;
      padding: 5px;
      font-size: small;
    }
 ```

9. Set the font-size to different values for example _smaller_, _small_, _medium_, _larger_, _xx-large_. Can you see that the **padding** \(space between the border and the text\) doesn't change?

10. With the padding staying the same, the space starts to look small as the text gets bigger. Let's give it a **relative** value instead of the **absolute** pixel value. Change it to
  ```css
    padding: 1em;
  ```

11. Now experiment again with different values for **font-size**. You should see the spacing change to match the font size this time.
 * Setting the size of anything to _1em_ makes it the same size as the text; setting it to _2em_ makes it twice the size of the text, and so on \(specifically, _1em_ is the width of the letter _m_!\).

12. You can use **em** values for anything you can set the size of, not just padding. Experiment with using it instead of **px** on borders, or instead of **%** on your image!

13. Once you're done experimenting, delete the **section** tags you added around the image and also delete the _#titoSection_ CSS block! Set the size of the Tito picture back to _100px_ as well.
