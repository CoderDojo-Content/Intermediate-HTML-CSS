1. Let's design a theme for the Attractions page that's different from the other pages. Go to your stylesheet file and add the following. Be sure to include the dot in front!
   ```css
          .pupleBackground {
              background-color: #9f80ff;
          }
   ```
   The dot makes this into a **class selector**. With a CSS **class** you can apply a set of CSS rules to any element on your website by adding an **attribute** to the element.
  * You could pick the colour to match the background of your page!

2. Now go to _attractions.html_ \(or the page you're working on if you're using your own project\) and add the following **attribute** to the **article** tag:

   ```html
        <article class="purpleBackground">
   ```
   You should see the background change around the text on the page.

3. Add the following class to your stylesheet:

   ```css
        .greenBackground {
            background-color: #48D1CC;
        }
   ```

   Back in the **html** file, add the **attribute** `class="greenBackground"` to each of the **section** tags, just like you did for the **article** element. Click Run and look at the Attractions page. Compare it to the other pages that have **section** elements.

4. When you use a CSS **element selector** such as **section**, the style rules apply to _all_ the elements of that type on your website. With CSS **classes** you're able to just change _some_ of them. You can add more than one class to an element too. Let's make another CSS **class** to give the sections some margin and padding. In _styles.css_, add the following code:
   ```css
        .sectionSpacing {
          padding: 10px;
          margin-top: 20px;
        }
   ```
5. In the **html** page you were working on, add the new class to each of the sections like this:
   ```html
        <section class="greenBackground sectionSpacing">
   ```
   You can add as many CSS classes to an element as you like. Just write the names of all the classes you want to use inside the **class attribute**, and separate them with spaces.

6. How about re-vamping the Food page? \(If you're using your own website, you'll need another page with some **sections** on it\) Add the following classes to your stylesheet:

   ```css
        .yellowBackground {
          background-color: #FFFFCC;
          color: #A52A2A;
        }

        .solidRoundBorders {
          border-style: solid;
          border-width: 2px;
          border-color: #F5FFFA;
          border-radius: 10px;
        }
   ```

   Go to the _food.html_ file \(or your own file\) and add the new classes as well as the `.sectionSpacing` class to each section:

   ```html
        <section class="yellowBackground sectionSpacing solidRoundBorders">
   ```

7. Notice how you can mix and match the classes in your element's class attribute? Using CSS classes lets you **reuse** the same set of style rules on lots of elements. You can apply them to any element that has the properties you've set. Go to _index.html_ and add the _solidRoundBorders_ class to the picture of Tito.

   ```html
        <img class="solidRoundBorders" src="tito.png" alt="Tito the dog" width="100px" />
   ```

8. Why not experiment with some more CSS classes to make the other pages have their own themes? You can name a CSS class anything you like. It's common to give it a name that describes what it does or what it's for!

9. Extra challenge: use CSS **classes** to define a few different picture sizes for the website, for example `.smallPictures` and `.mediumPictures`. Then remove the **width** attribute from each of your **img** elements and add the appropriate class instead.
