1. Take a look at your **stylesheet**. This is the file that has **.css** in the name.
2. Inside the CSS rules for `body`, set the background colour to
   ```
        background-color: #9ADC32;
   ```
   * If you are using a Mac, the **\#** is typed by holding the **alt** key and the number **3** key together.
3. When you click Run, your website should have a green background. 
4. As you have seen, you can type in many different colour names as words and the browser will recognise them. But a more common way to set colours is to use a code like the one above, called a **HEX** code.
5. Try it yourself: Go to dojo.soy/COLOURS-LIST-TODO and choose a colour for your website. But instead of typing the name of the colour, type in the HEX code.
 * The HEX colour code must start with a \# and contains 6 characters. The characters can be any number from 0-9 and any letter from A-F.
4. Fun exercise: Take your six-digit date of birth and put a `#` symbol in front to make your own unique personal colour code! Try it out in your stylesheetâ€“what colour did you get?
