1. Take a look at your **stylesheet**. This is the file that has **.css** in the name.
2. Inside the CSS rules for `body`, set the background colour to
   ```
        background-color: #9ADC32;
   ```

   * If you are using a Mac, the **\#** is typed by holding the **alt** key and the number **3** key together.
3. When you click Run, your website should have a green background. 
4. As you have seen, you can type in many different colour names as words and the browser will recognise them. But a more common way to set colours is to use a code like the one above, called a **HEX** code.
5. Try it yourself: Go to dojo.soy/COLOURS-LIST-TODO and choose a colour for your website. But instead of typing the name of the colour, type in the HEX code.
6. HEX codes allow you to mix any colour, even if it's not on any list of colours. Try making up your own colour code
   * The code must start with a `#`. This tells the browser that it is a HEX code instead of a colour name.
   * The rest of the code is made up of six characters. They can be  any number from 0-9 and any letter from A-F.
7. How does it work? Every colour is made by mixing three colors: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**. You may have seen this written down as **RGB**. Each of these colours is represented by two of the six digits in your code;

6. Fun exercise: Take your six-digit date of birth and put a `#` symbol in front to make your own unique personal colour code! Try it out in your stylesheetâ€“what colour did you get?
