1. Let's say you want to make CSS rules to style a certain few elements the same way.
2. Go to your stylesheet file and add the following. Be sure to include the dot in front!
    ```
        .cool-roundy-borders {
            border-style: solid;
            border-width: 2px;
            border-color: #ffe680;
            border-radius: 10px;
        }
    ```
3. Now go to one of your html files that has an `<img>` tag on it and add the following **attribute** to the tag
    ```
        class="cool-roundy-borders"
    ```
3. ** use img as the example?? **
4. ** create classes "round corners" and "square corners" and show that they can be used on anything that has the border-radius property! **
2. Choose one of your `<article>` blocks and add the following **attribute** to the opening tag
    ```
        <article class="
3. You decide the name for your CSS class can be called anything you like.
