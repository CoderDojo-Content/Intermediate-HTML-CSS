1. Here's a neat trick that will make trying out different styles quicker and easier: On your web page - the actual page, not the code, right click on some text and select the option **Inspect** from the menu that appears.
2. A whole new pane will appear in your web browser with lots of tabs and code: the **Developer Tools**. A little scary looking? Don't panic! You don't need to worry about most of it. Let's dive into the useful bits right away.
3. First, at the top right of this new pane, click on the three dots next to the **x** icon. In the menu that appears, look at the top item, the one that says "Dock side". Choose the **bottom** option. When you're familiar with the tools, you can choose to move the panel wherever you prefer.
4. You can drag the top border of the panel to make it bigger or smaller. Notice also that the pane is split into two panels? You can also drag the border in between them to change their size.

2. 3. Designing websites is fun for sure, but choosing the right colours, shapes and spacing can be hard, right? Especially when you have to keep reloading everything to test lots of different values. Luckily, there is a tool that makes testing easier: the Developer Tools.
