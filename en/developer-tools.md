1. Here's a neat trick that will make trying out different styles quicker and easier: On your web page - the actual page, not the code, right click on some text and select the option **Inspect** from the menu that appears.
2. A whole new pane will appear in your web browser with lots of tabs and code: the **Developer Tools**, or **Dev Tools** for short. At the top right of this new pane, click on the three dots next to the **x** icon. In the menu that appears, look at the top item, the one that says "Dock side". Choose the **bottom** option.
 * When you're familiar with the tools, you can choose to move the panel wherever you prefer.
3. Press the Esc key on your keyboard once or twice until the Dev Tools is split into two main panels rather than a super-crowded three. 
4. You can drag the border in between the panels to change their sizes. You can also drag the top border of the Dev Tools to make it bigger or smaller.

2. 3. Designing websites is fun for sure, but choosing the right colours, shapes and spacing can be hard, right? Especially when you have to keep reloading everything to test lots of different values. Luckily, there is a tool that makes testing easier: the Developer Tools.
