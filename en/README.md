1. To work through this Sushi Card series you will need to start with a website that you already made. For example you can use the one that you made in the Beginner HTML and CSS series. 
2. The Sushi Cards use Trinket \(dojo.soy/TRINKET-TODO-LINK\) for writing the website code. If you do not have an account on Trinket, it is recommended that you create one. It is free: all you need is an email address.
3. To make a copy of your website in Trinket, open it and click the "Duplicate" button. Change the name if you like, and then click "Save".
4. Or, if you prefer, you can go to [dojo.soy/html2-website]( and click "Remix". Then click on your username and go to "My Trinkets". You will see the remixed project. Open it and change the name if you like. Click "Save".
5. Once you have duplicated or remixed a trinket, change the name if you like, and then click "Save".
6. Just above the tabs in the code panel, click the icon and select either "Click to Run" or "Autorun".
   * Click to Run: Recommended. Any time you have made changes to your code, click the button to see the results.
   * Autorun: Your website will be automatically updated every time you make a change to the code. It doesn't always wait for you to stop typing, so this usually results in a lot of flashing of the page while you type! It also thinks there's errors when you haven't finished typing yet, which can be confusing.
