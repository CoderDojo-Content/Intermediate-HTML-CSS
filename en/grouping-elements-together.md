1. When you have a web page that's full of information, it's a good idea to try to organise it a bit so that it looks tidy and it's easy to read.
2. Headings of different sizes and paragraph tags are a great start, but there are more tags you can use to group things together in special containers.
3. Start by putting the main content of your page in between `<article></article>` tags. That would be everything after the header and before the footer.
4. If your page contains more than one separate item of content that are not really connected, put each one between its own set of `<article></article>` tags instead of putting one set of the tags around the whole lot.
 * **content** means information or pictures or any other "stuff" you have on the page!
 5. You can totally have `article`s inside `articles`: for example one big piece of content that's made up of a few smaller ones.
4. You can also break your `article` up into chunks. For example, you might have a few pieces of information that are sort of separate but are all connected, belonging to the one article. For this you've got the `<section></section>` tags.

5. ***TODO*** example of the whole page I suppose?
 
10. Confused about this container thing? Remember when you created a menu and then put it in between `<nav> </nav>` tags. This is another example of one of these containers. You simply put special tags around your menu to tell the browser that everything in between them belongs together. Like organising things in boxes and shelves in your home!
