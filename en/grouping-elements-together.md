1. When you have a web page that's full of information, it's a good idea to try to organise it a bit so that it looks tidy and it's easy to read.
2. Headings of different sizes and paragraph tags are a great start, but there are more tags you can use to group things together.
3. Start by putting the main content of your page in between `<article></article>` tags. If your page contains more than one separate item of content that are not really connected, put each one between its own set of `<article></article>` tags.
 * explain "piece of content" ?
 * You can have `article`s inside `articles`: for example one big piece of content that's made up of a few smaller ones.
4. You can also break your `article` up into chunks. For example, you might have a few pieces of information that are sort of separate but are all connected, belonging to the one article. For this you've got the `<section></section>` tags.

5. ***TODO*** example of the whole page I suppose?
 
10. Think of these tags as containers.  ... these tags act as containers that you put things in to keep them together...  Remember you put your menu in between nav tags. This is another example of one of these containers.
